Hello everyone,
The above challenge is a challenge that deals with the subject of static analysis.

To start the challenge download the compressed file in the folder, extract it and run the file.
Make sure that when you extract the file you get two files, a text file and a binary file.
The binary will not run without the text file so make sure they are both in the same folder.

Hope you enjoy and learn from the challenge.

Good luck!
